# Camel K: Event Streaming Example

This demo shows how Camel K can be used as glue for connecting various eventing platforms together (**Knative Eventing**, **Kafka** and **AMQ**) to develop advanced real-life applications.

The scenario implemented here is a system that handles different types of hazards and alert information.

## Before you begin

Make sure you check-out this repository from git and open it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Instructions are based on [VSCode Didact](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-didact), so make sure it's installed
from the VSCode extensions marketplace.

From the VSCode UI, right-click on the `readme.didact.md` file and select "Didact: Start Didact tutorial from File". A new Didact tab will be opened in VS Code.

Make sure you've opened this readme file with Didact before jumping to the next section.

## Preparing the cluster

This example can be run on any OpenShift 4.6+ cluster or a local development instance (such as [CRC](https://github.com/code-ready/crc)). Ensure that you have a cluster available and login to it using the OpenShift `oc` command line tool.

You need to create a new project named `camel-k-event-streaming` for running this example. This can be done directly from the OpenShift web console or by executing the command `oc new-project camel-k-event-streaming` on a terminal window.

You need to install the Camel K operator in the `camel-k-event-streaming` project. To do so, go to the OpenShift 4.x web console, login with a cluster admin account and use the OperatorHub menu item on the left to find and install **"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"**. You will be given the option to install it globally on the cluster or on a specific namespace.
If using a specific namespace, make sure you select the `camel-k-event-streaming` project from the dropdown list.
This completes the installation of the Camel K operator (it may take a couple of minutes).

When the operator is installed, from the OpenShift Help menu ("?") at the top of the WebConsole, you can access the "Command Line Tools" page, where you can download the **"kamel"** CLI, that is required for running this example. The CLI must be installed in your system path.

Refer to the **"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"** documentation for a more detailed explanation of the installation steps for the operator and the CLI.

### Installing the AMQ Streams Operator

This example uses AMQ Streams, Red Hat's data streaming platform based on Apache Kafka.
We want to install it on a new project named `event-streaming-kafka-cluster`.

You need to create the `event-streaming-kafka-cluster` project from the OpenShift web console or by executing the command `oc new-project event-streaming-kafka-cluster` on a terminal window.

Now, we can go to the OpenShift 4.x WebConsole page, use the OperatorHub menu item on the left hand side menu and use it to find and install **"Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams"**.
This will install the operator and may take a couple minutes to install.

### Installing the AMQ Broker Operator

The installation of the AMQ Broker follows the same isolation pattern as the AMQ Streams one. We will deploy it in a separate project and will
instruct the operator to deploy a broker according to the configuration.

You need to create the `event-streaming-messaging-broker` project from the OpenShift web console or by executing the command `oc new-project event-streaming-messaging-broker` on a terminal window.

Now, we can go to the OpenShift 4.x WebConsole page, use the OperatorHub menu item on the left hand side menu and use it to find and install **"Red Hat Integration - AMQ Broker"**.
This will install the operator and may take a couple minutes to install.

### Installing OpenShift Serverless

This demo also needs OpenShift Serverless (Knative) installed and working.

Go to the OpenShift 4.x WebConsole page, use the OperatorHub menu item on the left hand side then find and install **"OpenShift Serverless"**
from a channel that best matches your OpenShift version.

The operator installation page reports links to the documentation where you can find information about **additional steps** that must
be done in order to have OpenShift serverless completely installed into your cluster.

Make sure you follow all the steps in the documentation before continuing to the next section.

## Understanding the Demo Scenario

This demo simulates a global hazard alert system. The simulator consumes data from multiple public APIs available on the internet
as well as user-provided data that simulates different types of hazards (ie.: crime, viruses, natural hazards and others).
The system consumes data from sources such as OpenAQ API (an open API that is used to query air pollution information),
USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, etc to consume data about hazards and present information about them and warn the user
when certain incidents happen.

![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-event-streaming/master/docs/Diagram.png)

## 1. Creating the AMQ Streams Cluster

We switch to the `event-streaming-kafka-cluster` project to create the Kafka cluster:

```oc project event-streaming-kafka-cluster```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20project%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster&completion=Project%20changed. "Switched to the project that will run AMQ Streams "){.didact})

The next step is to use the operator to create an AMQ Streams cluster. This can be done with the command:

```oc create -f infra/kafka/clusters/event-streaming-cluster.yaml```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20create%20-f%20infra%2Fkafka%2Fclusters%2Fevent-streaming-cluster.yaml&completion=Created%20the%20AMQ%20Streams%20cluster. "Creates the AMQ Streams cluster"){.didact})

Depending on how large your OpenShift cluster is, this may take a little while to complete. Let's run this command and wait until the cluster is up and running.

```oc wait kafka/event-streaming-kafka-cluster --for=condition=Ready --timeout=600s```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20wait%20kafka%2Fevent-streaming-kafka-cluster%20--for=condition=Ready%20--timeout=600s&completion=Wait%20for%20the%20Kafka%20cluster. "Wait for the Kafka cluster"){.didact})

You can can check the state of the cluster by running the following command:


```oc get kafkas -n event-streaming-kafka-cluster event-streaming-kafka-cluster```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20kafkas%20-n%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster&completion=Check%20if%20the%20cluster%20was%20created. "Check if the cluster was created"){.didact})

Once the AMQ Streams cluster is created. We can proceed to the creation of the AMQ Streams topics:


```oc apply -f infra/kafka/clusters/topics/```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20apply%20-f%20infra%2Fkafka%2Fclusters%2Ftopics%2F&completion=Created%20topics. "Create topics"){.didact})

```oc get kafkatopics```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20kafkatopics&completion=Collected%20Kafka%20topics. "Collect Kafka topics"){.didact})

At this point, if all goes well, we should our AMQ Streams cluster up and running with several topics.

## 2. Creating the AMQ Broker Cluster

To switch to the `event-streaming-messaging-broker` project, run the following command:

```oc project event-streaming-messaging-broker```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20project%20event-streaming-messaging-broker&completion=Switched%20to%20project%20for%20running%20the%20AMQ%20Broker. "Switched to the project that will run the AMQ Broker"){.didact})

Having already the operator installed and running on the project, we can proceed to create the broker instance:


```oc create -f infra/messaging/broker/instances/amq-broker-instance.yaml```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20create%20-f%20infra%2Fmessaging%2Fbroker%2Finstances%2Famq-broker-instance.yaml&completion=Created%20AMQ%20Broker%20instance. "Creates the AMQ Broker instance"){.didact})


We can use the `oc get activemqartemises` command to check if the AMQ Broker instance is created:

```oc get activemqartemises```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20activemqartemises&completion=Verify%20the%20broker%20instances. "Verify the broker instances"){.didact})

If it was successfully created, then we can create the addresses and queues required for the demo to run:

```oc apply -f infra/messaging/broker/instances/addresses```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20apply%20-f%20infra%2Fmessaging%2Fbroker%2Finstances%2Faddresses&completion=Create%20the%20addresses. "Create the addresses"){.didact})


## 3. Deploying the Project

Now that the infrastructure is ready, we can go ahead and deploy the demo project. First, lets switch to the main project:

```oc project camel-k-event-streaming```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20project%20camel-k-event-streaming&completion=Switched%20to%20the%20demo%20project. "Switched to the demo project"){.didact})

We should now check that the operator is installed. To do so, execute the following command on a terminal:

```
oc get csv
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20csv&completion=Checking%20Cluster%20Service%20Versions. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

When Camel K is installed, you should find an entry related to `red-hat-camel-k-operator` in phase `Succeeded`.

NOTE: We use `Jitpack` to package the model project into a shared JAR that will be used by all integrations in this project. This configuration is handy but experimental and it may change in future versions. In a production scenario, we suggest you to deploy the model JAR into your own Maven registry and reference it in the platform configuration.

### Initial Configuration

Most of the components of the demo use use the [./application.properties](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./application.properties&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "Edit the application configuration"){.didact} to read the configurations they need to run. This file already comes with
expected defaults, so no action should be needed.

#### Optional: Configuration Adjustments

*Note*: you can skip this step if you don't want to adjust the configuration, but if you changed any of the namespaces or the service name, you should retrieve the correct addresses to set in the `application.properties` file.

In case you need to adjust the configuration, the following 2 commands present information that will be required to configure the deployment:

```oc get services -n event-streaming-messaging-broker```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20services%20-n%20event-streaming-messaging-broker&completion=Get%20the%20AMQ%20Broker%20services. "Get the AMQ Broker services"){.didact})

Get the kafka broker address:

```
oc -n event-streaming-kafka-cluster get kafka/event-streaming-kafka-cluster -ojsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="plain")].bootstrapServers}'
```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20-n%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster%20get%20kafka/event-streaming-kafka-cluster%20-ojsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="plain")].bootstrapServers}'&completion=Get%20the%20AMQ%20Streams%20services. "Get the AMQ Streams services"){.didact})

Or if you prefer to use this handy script to set it for you
```
kafka=$(oc get kafka/event-streaming-kafka-cluster -ojsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="plain")].bootstrapServers}' -n event-streaming-kafka-cluster); sed -i "/kafka.bootstrap.address/ s/=.*/=$kafka/g" application.properties
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kafka=$(oc%20get%20kafka/event-streaming-kafka-cluster%20-ojsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="plain")].bootstrapServers}'%20-n%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster);%20sed%20-i%20"/kafka.bootstrap.address/%20s/=.*/=$kafka/g"%20application.properties&completion=Set%20the%20Kafka%20Address. "Set the Kafka Address"){.didact})


They provide the addresses of the services running on the cluster and can be used to fill in the values on the properties file.

We start by opening the file [./application.properties](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./application.properties&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "Edit the config map"){.didact} and editing the parameters. The content needs to be adjusted to point to the correct addresses of the brokers. It should be similar to this:

```
kafka.bootstrap.address=event-streaming-kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.event-streaming-kafka-cluster:9092
quarkus.qpid-jms.url=amqp://broker-hdls-svc.event-streaming-messaging-broker:5672
```

#### Creating the Secret

One of the components simulates receiving data from users and, in order to do so, authenticate the users. Because we normally don't want the credentials to be easily
accessible, it simulates checking the access control by reading a secret.

We can push the secret to the cluster using the following command:

```oc create secret generic example-event-streaming-user-reporting --from-file application.properties```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20create%20secret%20generic%20example-event-streaming-user-reporting%20--from-file%20application.properties&completion=Created%20the%20secret%20configuration. "Creates the secret configuration"){.didact})

With this configuration secret created on the cluster, we have completed the initial steps to get the demo running.

### Running the OpenAQ Consumer

Now we will deploy the first component of the demo: [./OpenAQConsumer.java](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./OpenAQConsumer.java&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "View the source code"){.didact}

```kamel run OpenAQConsumer.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20OpenAQConsumer.java&completion=Started%20the%20OpenAQ%20Consumer. "Creates and starts the OpenAQ Consumer"){.didact})


**Details**: this starts an integration that consumes data from the [OpenAQ](https://docs.openaq.org/) API, splits each record and sends them to
our AMQ Stream instance. The demo addresses for the AMQ Streams broker is stored in the `example-event-streaming` which is inject into the demo
code and used to reach the instance.


### Running the USGS Earthquake Alert System Consumer

The second component on our demo is a [consumer](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./EarthquakeConsumer.java&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "View the source code"){.didact} for events from the [USGS Earthquake Alert System](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/).

```kamel run EarthquakeConsumer.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20EarthquakeConsumer.java&completion=Started%20the%20USGS%20Earhquake%20Alert%20Consumer. "Creates and starts the USGS Earthquake Alert Consumer"){.didact})


**Details**: this works in a similar way to the OpenAQ consumer.


### Running the GateKeeper

This service leverages [knative eventing channels](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/channels/) to operate. Therefore, we need to create
them on the OpenShift cluster. To do so we can execute the following command:

```oc apply -f infra/knative/channels/audit-channel.yaml```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20apply%20-f%20infra%2Fknative%2Fchannels%2Faudit-channel.yaml&completion=Create%20Knative%20eventing%20channel. "Create knative eventing channel"){.didact})


The [Gatekeeper service](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./GateKeeper.java&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "View the source code"){.didact} simulates a service that is used to audit accesses to the system. It leverages knative support from Camel-K.

```kamel run GateKeeper.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20GateKeeper.java&completion=Run%20the%20GateKeeper%20audit. "Run the GateKeeper audit"){.didact})

**Details**: this works in a similar way to the OpenAQ consumer.

### Running the User Report System


The [User Report System](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=./UserReportSystem.java&newWindow=false&completion=Ok. "View the source code"){.didact}  simulates a service that is used to receive user-generated reports on the system. It receives events sent by the user and sends them to the AMQ Streams instance. To run this component execute the following command:

```kamel run UserReportSystem.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20UserReportSystem.java&completion=Run%20the%20User%20Report%20System. "Run the User Report System"){.didact})


### Running the Service Bridges

The service bridges consume the event data and prepare them for consumption.

#### Running the Pollution Bridge

This service consumes the pollution events and sends it to the timeline topic for consumption.

```kamel run PollutionBridge.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20PollutionBridge.java&completion=Run%20the%20Pollution%20bridge. "Run the Pollution bridge"){.didact})


#### Running the Earthquake Bridge

```kamel run EarthquakeBridge.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20EarthquakeBridge.java&completion=Run%20the%20Earthquake%20Bridge. "Run the Earthquake Bridge"){.didact})


#### Running the Health Alert Bridge

```kamel run HealthBridge.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20HealthBridge.java&completion=Run%20the%20HealthBridge. "Run the HealthBridge"){.didact})


#### Running the Crime Bridge

```kamel run CrimeBridge.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20CrimeBridge.java&completion=Run%20the%20CrimeBridge. "Run the CrimeBridge"){.didact})

#### Running the Timeline Bridge

```kamel run TimelineBridge.java```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20run%20TimelineBridge.java&completion=Run%20the%20Timeline%20Bridge. "Run the Timeline Bridge"){.didact})


#### Checking the State of the Integrations

Now that we launched all the services, let's check the state of our integrations. We can do
so with the command:

```kamel get```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$kamel%20get&completion=Checked%20the%20state%20of%20the%20integrations. "Checks the state of the integrations"){.didact})


#### Running the Front-end

This web front end queries the timeline bridge service and displays the events collected at the time. We will use
OpenShift build services to build a container with the front-end and run it on the cluster.

The front-end image leverages the official [Apache Httpd 2.4](https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=tech-details#/registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7) image from Red Hat's container registry.

We can proceed to creating the build configuration and starting the build within the OpenShift cluster. The
following command replaces the URL for the timeline API on the Javascript code and launches an image build.


```URL=$(oc get ksvc timeline-bridge -o 'jsonpath={.status.url}') ; cat ./front-end/Dockerfile| oc new-build --docker-image="registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest" --to=front-end --build-arg="URL=$URL" -D -```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$URL%3D%24(oc%20get%20ksvc%20timeline-bridge%20-o%20%27jsonpath%3D%7B.status.url%7D%27)%20%3B%20cat%20.%2Ffront-end%2FDockerfile%7C%20oc%20new-build%20--docker-image%3D%22registry.access.redhat.com%2Frhscl%2Fhttpd-24-rhel7%3Alatest%22%20--to%3Dfront-end%20--build-arg%3D%22URL%3D%24URL%22%20-D%20-&completion=Created%20the%20build%20configuration. "Creates the build configuration"){.didact})


With the build complete, we can go ahead and create a deployment for the front-end:

```oc apply -f front-end/front-end.yaml```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20apply%20-f%20front-end%2Ffront-end.yaml&completion=Deployed%20the%20front-end. "Deploys the front-end"){.didact})

The last thing missing is finding the URL for the front-end so that we can open it on the browser.

To find the public API for the service, we can run the following command:

```oc get routes front-end-external -o 'jsonpath={.spec.port.targetPort}://{.spec.host}'```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20get%20routes%20front-end-external%20-o%20%27jsonpath=%7B.spec.port.targetPort%7D:%2F%2F%7B.spec.host%7D%27&completion=Found%20the%20front-end%20URL. "Gets the front-end URL"){.didact})

Open this URL on the browser and we can now access the front-end.

## 4. Uninstall

To cleanup everything, execute the following command:

```oc delete project camel-k-event-streaming event-streaming-messaging-broker event-streaming-kafka-cluster```

([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20delete%20project%20camel-k-event-streaming%20event-streaming-messaging-broker%20event-streaming-kafka-cluster&completion=Removed%20the%20projects%20from%20the%20cluster. "Cleans up the cluster after running the projects"){.didact})

## 5. Troubleshooting

#### Too many user-report-system pods exhausting the worker node

If it occurs a fast creation of many `user-report-system` pods and many of them in error state, the pod is not starting properly. As this specific integration has a `rest` endpoint and is running with Knative enabled cluster, Camel K will set this deployment as a Knative Service instead of a regular Kubernetes Deployment, then as the pod is Unhealthy, Knative Serving keeps creating other pods, this behavior may exhaust the worker node. To troubleshoot this error, run the integration with the Knative Service trait disabled by adding the parameter `-t knative-service.enabled=false` when running the `UserReportSystem.java` integration, this way a regular Kubernetes Deployment is used and only one pod is created, so having only one pod is easier to examine the pod and it's log to determine the error cause.
